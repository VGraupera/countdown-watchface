Countdown Watchface
===================

Countdown is watchface for the [Pebble Smartwatch](https://getpebble.com) that shows how much time to go until a date in the future, or since a date in the past. Use to mark important upcoming milestones i.e. days until an important birthday, product launch, wedding, when you are expecting a child, etc.

You can track up to 30 events. Shake your wrist to switch between different countdowns.
